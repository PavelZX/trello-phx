# Comeonin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/riverrun/comeonin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/riverrun/comeonin) [![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/comeonin.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/comeonin)

Password hashing (bcrypt, pbkdf2_sha512 and one-time passwords) library for Elixir.

This library is intended to make it very straightforward for developers
to check users' passwords in as secure a manner as possible.

Comeonin supports `bcrypt` and `pbkdf2_sha512`.

Argon2, the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition, is maintained
as a [separate package](https://github.com/riverrun/argon2_elixir).
See the [Argon2](https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/wiki/Argon2)
page in the wiki for more details about Argon2.

Comeonin also supports one-time passwords, for use in two-factor authentication.

## Features

* Comeonin uses the most secure, well-tested, and up-to-date hashing schemes.
    * Bcrypt and Pbkdf2 have no known vulnerabilities and have been widely tested for over 10 years
    * Argon2 is maintained as a separate package.
* It uses the latest version of bcrypt, supporting the $2b$ prefix.
* It is easy to use.
    * Salts are generated by default.
    * Each function has sensible, secure defaults.
* It provides excellent documentation.
    * Clear instructions are given on how to use Comeonin.
    * Several recommendations are also given to help developers keep their apps secure.

## Requirements and build errors

See the [Requirements](https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/wiki/Requirements)
page in the wiki for details.

### Docker

You need to build the comeonin app inside the docker image.
To do this, add the following line to the docker file:

    RUN cd deps/comeonin && make clean && make

## Installation

1. Add comeonin to your `mix.exs` dependencies

  ```elixir
  defp deps do
    [ {:comeonin, "~> 3.0"} ]
  end
  ```

2. List `:comeonin` as an application dependency

  ```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:logger, :comeonin]]
  end
  ```

3. Run `mix do deps.get, compile`

4. Optional: during tests (and tests only), you may want to reduce the number of bcrypt,
or pbkdf2, rounds so it does not slow down your test suite. If you have a `config/test.exs`,
you should add (depending on which algorithm you are using):

  ```elixir
  config :comeonin, :bcrypt_log_rounds, 4
  config :comeonin, :pbkdf2_rounds, 1
  ```

  NB: do not use the above values in production.

## Usage

Either import or alias the algorithm you want to use -- either `Comeonin.Bcrypt`
or `Comeonin.Pbkdf2`.

Both algorithms have the `hashpwsalt` function, which is a convenience
function that automatically generates a salt and then hashes the password.

To hash a password with the default options:

    hash = hashpwsalt("difficult2guess")

See each module's documentation for more information about
all the available options.

To check a password against the stored hash, use the `checkpw`
function. This takes two arguments: the plaintext password and
the stored hash:

    checkpw(password, stored_hash)

There is also a `dummy_checkpw` function, which takes no arguments
and is to be used when the username cannot be found. It performs a hash,
but then returns false. This can be used to make user enumeration more
difficult.
